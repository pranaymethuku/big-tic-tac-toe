* Uses dynamic programming concepts to ensure constant time termination state checks.

## Requirements
For the program to run, you must have a recent Java Development Kit (JDK) on your machine.

## How to run

Once you have cloned the repo, navigate into the root directory, and run `make` on the terminal, followed by `java -cp bin/ TicTacToe`.
